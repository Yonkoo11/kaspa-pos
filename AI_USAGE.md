# AI Usage Disclosure

This project was built with AI assistance as part of the Kaspathon hackathon.

## Tools Used

- **Claude Code (Claude Opus 4.6)** -- AI coding assistant used for code generation, debugging, and iteration

## What AI Did

- Generated initial project scaffold and component structure
- Wrote Svelte components (AmountEntry, PaymentQR, Confirmation, History)
- Implemented UTXO polling logic and payment detection
- Created the speed comparison visualization
- Wrote CSS animations and styling
- Helped debug reactivity issues (Svelte store bindings)
- Generated README documentation

## What the Human Did

- Conceived the product idea (instant PoS terminal for Kaspa)
- Defined the UX flow and feature set
- Chose the tech stack and architecture
- Directed all design decisions (dark theme, calculator layout, speed comparison bars)
- Tested with real Kaspa addresses and API
- Reviewed and approved all code
- Deployed to GitHub Pages
- Created the demo video

## How AI Was Used

The development process was collaborative: the human described what to build and made design/architecture decisions, while AI generated code and helped iterate on implementation details. All code was reviewed before being committed. The human drove the creative direction; AI handled the execution.
