# Design Progress: KaspaPOS

Started: 2026-02-12
Style Config: ~/.claude/style.config.md
Color Mode: dark-only (POS terminal, crypto fintech, dark IS the identity)
Flags: none (full workflow)

## Phase 1: State Design
Status: skipped (state already built: stores/pos.ts with full state machine - idle/waiting/confirmed)
Output: src/stores/pos.ts

## Phase 2: Creative (3 Proposals)
Status: completed
Proposals: proposal-1-terminal.html, proposal-2-liquid.html, proposal-3-stark.html
DNA Codes: DNA-MONO-BRUTAL-SHARP-FAST-DARK, DNA-GLASS-FLUID-ROUND-GLOW-DARK, DNA-STARK-TYPE-MINIMAL-SHARP-DARK

## Phase 3: Selection
Status: completed
Selected: hybrid (LIQUID + STARK)
Direction: STARK typography hierarchy (massive numbers, minimal decoration, spacing-driven layout) + LIQUID material quality (glass surfaces, backdrop-blur, teal glow atmosphere, animated blobs). Restraint in layout, premium in material.

## Phase 4: Production Polish
Status: in-progress

## Phase 5: Final QA
Status: pending
